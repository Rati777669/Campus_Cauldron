# `Project Title`: Campus_Cauldron

Our project aims to share the precise amount of information that would be beneficial to many Bencolites throughout their Campus life!!
We want to bridge the gap between students who have knowledge and those who seek for it.
Campus Cauldron's motto is to bring BIETians together to ask, answer and seek information brewing in the same cauldron. Their regular visit on our website will be most valued.
